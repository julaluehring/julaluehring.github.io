I work as a pre-doctoral researcher in the [Computational Communication Science Lab](https://compcommlab.univie.ac.at/) at the University of Vienna and the [Complexity Science Hub](https://csh.ac.at/) in Vienna.
My research focuses on understanding how groups of people belonging to the same society develop diverging realities and how these realities are shaped by psychological and technological dynamics (read more about the projects in the [research section](/projects/)).

While I am a social scientist at heart, I combine a variety of methods to approach this problem. I enjoy truly interdisciplinary settings, collaborating with and learning from computer scientists and physicists in my team.
I'm particularly interested in how we can reliably use computational and complex methods to study social phenomena, often analyzing large-scale social media data to study such phenomena *in the wild*.
For instance, to study effects of misinformation online -- where randomization is impossible --, I have applied causal inference approaches on observational data, and to understand potential selection effects, I have used panel study designs on social media users.

My educational background is (political) communication science and polito-linguistics. I received my M.Sc. in Communication Science from the University of Amsterdam and my B.A. in German Language from the University of Bremen (check out my educational background in [resume](/resume/)).
During my doctoral education, I am learning *a lot* about machine learning and working efficiently and transparently with massive datasets remotely. 
Hit me up if you are interested in collaboration, have a question, or just want to chat about the best workflows, or social media data!
