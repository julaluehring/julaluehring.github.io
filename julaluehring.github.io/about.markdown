Hi! My name is Jula. I work as a PhD in the [Computational Communication Science Lab](https://compcommlab.univie.ac.at/) and the [Complexity Science Hub](https://csh.ac.at/) in Vienna, Austria.
I wonder how humans behave on social media. For my current project, I am studying the spread of misinformation on social media and the impact of emotions on this phenomenon.
