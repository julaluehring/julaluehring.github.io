Hi! I am a pre-doctoral researcher based in Vienna.
My research interests are in the field of computational social science, with a focus on natural language processing and social media data analysis.
I am currently working on projects related to misinformation, inter-group hostility, and polarization.

Here is a video that gives a 3-minute introduction to my research:
